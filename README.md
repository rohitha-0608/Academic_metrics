# Academic Metrics 📚✨  

## Overview  
Academic Metrics is a machine learning project that predicts student marks based on their study hours using linear regression. It provides insights into the relationship between study time and academic performance through an interactive interface.  

## Features  
- 📈 Predicts marks based on input study hours.  
- 📊 Displays performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- 💾 Saves predictions and inputs to a CSV file for record-keeping.  
- 🌐 User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit  
- Pickle  

## Performance Metrics  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.1080  
- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9514 (95.14%)  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.8781  

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates a robust and accurate regression model capable of predicting student marks with high precision. It offers valuable insights into how study hours impact academic performance.
